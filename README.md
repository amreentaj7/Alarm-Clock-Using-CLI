# Alarm-Clock-Using-CLI

This is an interesting Command Line Interface (CLI) Python application . People across the
globe use alarm clock features in their devices but this project is altered in a bit different
manner . Some certain YouTube links are added to a text file and the project is programmed
in a way that when a user sets an alarm then the code picks a random link from the video and
will start playing the YouTube link.
